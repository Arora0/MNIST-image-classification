# Handwritten-digit image classification with Neural Network
This project deals with an introductory example in Deep Learning. A subset of hand-written digits data has been taken from [Yann LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The code does not deal much with data manipulation as the images have already been centered and appropriately transformed.

# Libraries required.
The following libraries are required for the functioning of the code. *PyTorch*, *torchvision*, *sklearn*, *numpy* and *matplotlib*.
#### This project employs PyTorch to define the neural network and the optimizer. But first, numpy needs to be installed.
`pip install numpy`
#### For sklearn
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
#### The instructions to download pytorch for CPU can be obtained [here](https://pytorch.org/).
